## Lab Setup

### Deployment
- Option 1: [AWS Provisioner](https://github.com/redhat-partner-tech/partner-tech-days-march2021/blob/main/integrated-mgmt-workshop/provision-aws.md) (awscli)  
- Option 2: [RHPDS](https://github.com/redhat-partner-tech/partner-tech-days-march2021/blob/main/integrated-mgmt-workshop/provision-rhpds.md) (Coming soon)

### Configure
After the workshop is deployed, you will need to configure the environment<br>
- [Configure Workshop Environment](https://github.com/redhat-partner-tech/partner-tech-days-march2021/blob/main/integrated-mgmt-workshop/configure.md)<br>

This step will configure the deployed environment, including Activation Keys, Lifecycle Environments, Registering Servers to Satellite Server, etc.

| Role                 | Inventory name |
| ---------------------| ---------------|
| Automation Platform  | ansible-1      |
| Satellite Server     | satellite      |
| Managed Host 1       | node1-rhel     |
| Managed Host 2       | node2-rhel     |
